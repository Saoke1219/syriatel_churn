    "### DATA UNDERSTANDING:\n",
    "The dataset used in this project was obtained from SyriaTelcom's internal database, which contains comprehensive records of customer interactions and telecommunications services(+3000 customers and 20 columns).This makes it highly suitable for addressing the business problem at hand of predicting customer churn for Syria Telcom.Contained in the dataset are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensive customer information:Contains a set of variables that provide insights into customer behavior, preferences, and usage patterns. This includes features such as account length, call details (e.g., duration, charges), service subscriptions (e.g., voice mail plan, international plan), and customer service interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historical Data: The dataset spans a considerable time period, allowing us to analyze historical trends and patterns in customer churn. By leveraging historical data, we can identify recurring patterns and factors that contribute to customer attrition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Granular Call Details: Detailed information about call usage, including call duration, charges, and time of day, enables us to explore how different calling patterns may influence customer churn. This granularity allows for a more nuanced understanding of customer behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Variable (Churn): The dataset includes a binary target variable indicating whether a customer has churned or not. This allows us to frame the prediction task as a supervised learning problem, where the goal is to accurately classify customers as churners or non-churners based on their characteristics and behavior.\n",
