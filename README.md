SYRIATEL CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION

PROJECT OVERVIEW: 

In Syria, the telecommunications industry faces a significant challenge in retaining customers amidst increasing competition and evolving consumer preferences. SyriaTelcom, one of the leading telecom service providers in the country, seeks to reduce customer churn by identifying patterns and factors contributing to customer attrition. High customer churn not only results in revenue loss but also undermines the company's reputation and market position.

BUSINESS PROBLEM OBJECTIVE:

SyriaTel, a telecommunications company, aims to proactively address customer churn to retain valuable customers, reduce revenue loss, and enhance overall customer satisfaction and loyalty. To achieve this objective, SyriaTel seeks to develop a predictive model capable of identifying customers at risk of churn. By leveraging historical customer data and predictive analytics, SyriaTel aims to anticipate potential churn events and implement targeted retention strategies to mitigate churn and foster long-term customer relationships.

OBJECTIVE:

The objective of this project is to analyze SyriaTelcom's customer data to understand the factors influencing churn and develop predictive models to forecast customer attrition. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics, the project aims to:

Identify key features and patterns associated with customer churn and non-churn.

Build predictive models to forecast the likelihood of churn for individual subscribers.

Provide actionable insights to SyriaTelcom for implementing targeted retention strategies and reducing customer attrition.

Enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty by addressing the underlying issues driving churn.

Improve SyriaTelcom's market position and competitiveness in the telecommunications industry by fostering long-term customer relationships.
